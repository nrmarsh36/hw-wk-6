# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I have the app to the point where it will successfully search for the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the city that is searched, and the 5-day forecast. However, the user has to click on the buttons to search for the desired weather, and the user has to click the search button in order to clear out the content of the previous city's weather. 

I could not figure out how to format the UV index or the localStorage.
